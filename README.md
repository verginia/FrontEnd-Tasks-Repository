distance to Mars in kilometers by the miles per kilometer.
b) Next, we need a variable to hold the hours it would take to get to Mars. To get the hours, you
need to divide the miles to Mars by the shuttle's speed.
c) Finally, declare a variable and assign it the value of days to Mars. In order to get the days it will
take to reach Mars, you need to divide the hours it will take to reach Mars by 24.

2. Write a JavaScript function that if will receive a number as argument will return the reverse of it. For example: 345 => 543 and if will receive as argument a string will 
  return this string with letters ordered by alphabetical order. Ex: ‘anb’ => ‘abn’

Task-22_JavaScript_Arrays_Continue
## Task 22:

1. Write a program which will receive as an argument an array of data containing also duplicated values and will return an array of uniques values. As result we should also show the most frequent item from initial array. (ex: [1, 4, 5, 1, 5, 1] => [1, 4, 5] ‘most frequent is 1’)
2. Write a program which will receive as argument an array of numbers and will return the minimum and the maximum numbers from it.
3. Write a program in which user will add value from input and they will create an array with entered values. On display click we should see every element position and value as in the image below: (you can enter any type of data, not just numbers)

![addDisplay](app/images/task22/addDisplay.png)

## Task 23:
1. Think of a way to introduce some events on your page on your own project.
2. Add a span to an HTML page and style it to appear like a button. Add a listener for click events to the button so that, when the button is clicked, an image of your choosing is displayed below the button. The image may be present in the mark-up before the button is clicked, but should be hidden from view. Add a second event handler to the image. When the image is clicked, hide the image again. Add a second button (also built from a span element) next to the first one. When this button is clicked, the event listener should completely remove the image from the page. Don’t forget to remove the event handler attached to the image.
3. Add an event listener for click events on an element of your choice. The event listener should maintain a count of the number of times the element is clicked. Log the count to the console each time it increments. *Add an event listener for keyboard events to the html element of a web page. When a specific combination of keys are pressed (for example, a, b,
c, d), display a specific message.
4. Create a form with five input fields and a submit button. Without using the required attribute, catch form submissions and reject them if each field has not been completed.

Task-24_JavaScript_Objects
## Task 24:
1. Create a simple "Car" object that has the following properties:
● make (e.g., "Toyota")
● model (e.g., "Camry")
● year (e.g., 2020)
● color (e.g., "red")
And the following methods:
● start: This method should simply console log "The car is starting" when called.
● drive: This method should console log "The car is driving" when called.
● stop: This method should console log "The car is stopped" when called.
● honk: This method should console log "Honk Honk!" when called
You can add more details to the object, like adding fuel consumption and speed or make the car object to be controlled by a driver object. You can also create multiple car object and see the result.

2.  Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings). On separate lines (one statement for each), show the recipe information so it looks like:
![ingredients](app/images/task24/ingredients.png)

3. Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet). Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien". Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'

Task-25_JavaScript_Objects_Methods
## Task 25:

1. Create a "Book" object that has the following properties:
● title (e.g., "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone")
● author (e.g., "J.K. Rowling")
● pages (e.g., 300)
● currentPage (e.g., 1)
And the following methods:
● read: This method should take in a number as an argument, and it should increment
the currentPage property by that number. It should also console log the message
"Reading [x] pages" where x is the number of pages read.
● checkPage: This method should console log the current page number
● checkPercentage: This method should console log the percentage of pages read.
● isRead: a method that return true or false if the book is read or not.

2. Create an object called "rectangle" that has the following properties:
● width
● height
And the following getters and setters:
● perimeter: This getter should return the perimeter of the rectangle (width +
height) * 2
● area: This getter should return the area of the rectangle (width * height)
● width: This setter should set the width of the rectangle and should not allow
negative values.
● height: This setter should set the height of the rectangle and should not allow
negative values.
